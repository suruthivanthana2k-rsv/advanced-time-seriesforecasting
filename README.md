# Advanced Time Series Forecasting with LSTM/Transformer + Explainability

This project implements a complete deep learning–based forecasting system using
LSTM/Transformer architectures, hyperparameter optimization, and explainability
techniques (SHAP / Integrated Gradients). A statistical baseline (SARIMAX /
Prophet) is also included.

## Features
- Multivariate time series dataset generator (5+ features, 1000+ timesteps)
- LSTM + Transformer deep learning models
- Optuna hyperparameter optimization
- Explainability via SHAP + Integrated Gradients
- Baseline forecasting using SARIMAX
- Modular, production-quality code (functions, type-hints, docstrings)
